## Introduction

Have you ever wondered how some apps and sites let you check the weather?

We're going to learn to build a web app that displays the current weather, using HTML, CSS, JavaScript and APIs!

With the power of Open Weather API, we can check the weather by location.

We will learn to utilize the following:

  <li>Changing what's on the rendered page.</li>
</ul>
